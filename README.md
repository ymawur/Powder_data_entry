# Powder_data_entry

This is a small project to create a powder data registration system. 

## Ingredient Registration Form

Run the Flask application to start a simple ingredient registration form backed by an SQLite database.

```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to use the form. The form is a skeleton where you can add new fields in `templates/ingredient_form.html` and modify the table definition in `app.py`.
